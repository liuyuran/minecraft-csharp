Main project of my unity game
---

That game is minecraft-like, but have no idea to make what game, and what gameplay it include.

Well, I want to create a game that need lower resource(maybe more, because I'm not a pro game engineer, but a java web engineer).

It won't evolution to another minetest or minecraft, I'm sure I don't want it.

So careful, maybe you don't want to watch that repo after read readme.

Hope politics never kill my dreams.

## project structure

- `minecraft-base` public code
- `minecraft-unity` client code
- `minecraft-server` server code
